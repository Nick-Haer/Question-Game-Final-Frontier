# Question-Game-Final-Frontier
A space themed guessing game based off of hangman, and created to practice JavaScript basics and DOM manipulation.

A project I especially enjoyed, this Hangman style game was designed to showcase learning in design, DOM manipulation, and logic. The greatest difficulties I faced in this project were dynamically updating the value of elements on the page, as this was my first time working with the DOM, and how to write the logic to alter and the display a new array, as this was my first time doing so as well. I also researched how to embed youtube videos to the page, and succesfully added a different video for each stage of the game.

The result is a fun game that has a soundtrack, a win condition, lose condition, and evocative design. Check it out at
